# Purpose:
# This program determines the runoff ratio of the Mississippi River at # Fergusons Falls and 
# compares it to the average runoff ratio of the Mississippi Valley Watershed. Calculating the 
# runoff ratio is important for flood control and possible flood zone hazard delineation. 
# Our programâ€™s target audience are hydrologists, water resource and flood risk specialists. 
# It will also be accessible to the general public as it may be especially useful to those 
# residing close to the river
#
# Program structure:
# First the program converts daily discharge to runoff and sums it up to get yearly discharge. Then the 
# program sums up daily precipitation to get year precipitation. Afterwards, annual runoff ratio is 
# calculated by dividing yearly precipitation with yearly runoff. Then the stream runoff ratio is compared
# to the average runoff ratio of the watershed that the stream lies in and the program states whether the 
# stream has a higher/lower runoff ratio than the watershed. 
#
# Assumptions/Planned for limitations:
# For simplicity purposes, the program only has the option of two years (2018, 2008) and one
# stream (Mississippi River at Ferguson Falls). Therefore, this program assumes that the 
# users are only interested in this stream and watershed, however, the program has the potential to be 
# scaled up to include other streams and watersheds. Precipitation and runoff data that was available and 
# used to calculate the average runoff ratio of the Mississippi Valley Watershed spans 29 years
# only, from 1971 to 2000, which may impact its accuracy in the comparison result. 
# 
# Inputs:
# Inputs are daily discharge and daily precipitation of csv files of Mississippi River at Ferguson Falls
# in csv format for 2008 and 2018 (Discharge2008, Discharge2018, Precipitation2008, Precipitation2018). 
# All these input files are already formatted according to month and day, with all unnecessary years 
# and fields removed. In addition, the program wil prompt for user input for which year they wish to view. 
#
# Output: 
# The output is via a screen/command prompt. Data error/accuracy is dependent on data provided by 
# Environment Canada/Government of Canada. Rounding to two decimal places may give an error of +/- 0.001. 

# Units:
# Discharge (m3/s) converted to Runoff (mm)
# Precipitation (mm)
# Drainage area for river (m2)
# Runoff ratio (no units)
