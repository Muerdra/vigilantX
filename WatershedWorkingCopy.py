This program that (1) calculates the annual runoff ratio of an individual stream from yearly precipitation and yearly runoff; (2) compares the stream runoff ratio to the average runoff ratio of the watershed that the stream lies in; and (3) states whether the stream has a higher/lower runoff ratio than the watershed. Data for daily discharge and precipitation needs to be sorted by year and discharge also needs to be converted from m3/s into runoff (mm) in order to calculate runoff ratio.
